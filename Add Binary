Given two binary strings a and b, return their sum as a binary string.

 

Example 1:

Input: a = "11", b = "1"
Output: "100"
Example 2:

Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
Output: "10101"
 

Constraints:

1 <= a.length, b.length <= 104
a and b consist only of '0' or '1' characters.
Each string does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself.

Initial brute force approach:
Convert the binary strings to integers, add them together, then convert the sum to a binary string.

public class Solution {
    public string AddBinary(string a, string b) {
        int base10_a = Convert.ToInt32(a, 2);
        int base10_b = Convert.ToInt32(b, 2);

        int base10_answer = base10_a + base10_b;

        string answer = Convert.ToString(base10_answer, 2);

        return answer;
    }
}

The approach works but won't pass when a and b are very long.
The key to the problem is using a carry and directly adding the binary numbers.
